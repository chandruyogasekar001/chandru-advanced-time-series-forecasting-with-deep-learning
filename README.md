## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **advanced time series forecasting pipeline** that goes beyond traditional statistical methods such as ARIMA and SARIMA. A **deep learning-based LSTM model** is used to perform **multi-step ahead forecasting** on a **synthetically generated multivariate time series dataset**.

A core focus of this project is **model interpretability**, achieved through **Explainable AI (XAI)** using **SHAP**, making the solution suitable for regulated and high-stakes environments.
